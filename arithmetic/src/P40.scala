// P40 (**) Goldbach's conjecture.
// Goldbach's conjecture says that every positive even number greater than 2
// is the sum of two prime numbers.  E.g. 28 = 5 + 23.  It is one of the
// most famous facts in number theory that has not been proved to be correct
// in the general case.  It has been numerically confirmed up to very large
// numbers (much larger than Scala's Int can represent).  Write a function
// to find the two prime numbers that sum up to a given even integer.
//
// scala> 28.goldbach
// res0: (Int, Int) = (5,23)

object P40:
  // This implementation isn't very efficient because the primes are generated
  // eagerly. It works much better in Haskell where list is lazy.
