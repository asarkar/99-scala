// P70 (**) Tree construction from a node string.
//
// We suppose that the nodes of a multiway tree contain single characters.
// In the depth-first order sequence of its nodes, a special character ^
// has been inserted whenever, during the tree traversal, the move is a
// backtrack to the previous level.
//
// By this rule, the tree in the figure opposite is represented as:
//
// afg^^c^bd^e^^^
// Define the syntax of the string and write a function string2MTree to construct
// an MTree from a String.â€‰ Make the function an implicit conversion from String.
// Write the reverse function, and make it the toString method of MTree.
//
// scala> MTree('a', List(MTree('f', List(MTree('g'))), MTree('c'), MTree('b', List(MTree('d'), MTree('e'))))).toString
// res0: String = afg^^c^bd^e^^^
